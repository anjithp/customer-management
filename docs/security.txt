Security of the CDM REST APIs can be implemented using oauth protocol.  Following are the brief implementation steps that I would do.

1)	Customer registers his  profile and we save his credentials in the database securley.
2)	Whenever customer wants to do subsequent operations on his profile then he shares his username/password once to the system using login API( over SSL) then the resource server will provide a temporary hmac based token. 
3)	Customer will use the token received in the above step for further operations.
4)	We can also make sure that one customer canâ€™t modify the data of another customer(s).
5)	For more granular control, we can implement RBAC so that admins can also change the customer information if required.
